        HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content
        on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and latest major version of HTML
        that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current
        specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by
        a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and
        Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group
        (WHATWG).
        <br />
        <br />
        HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with
        a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its
        goals were to improve the language with support for the latest
        multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily
        readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices
        such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to
        remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to
        subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.

        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
        like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
        alongside HTML and JavaScript.
        <br />
        <br />
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
        including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
        accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
        of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share
        formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and
        reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content. Separation
        of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same
        markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as
        on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
        reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
        alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device. The
        name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine
        which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular
        element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
        <br />
        <br />
        The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium
        (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use
        with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS
        validation service for CSS documents. In addition to HTML, other markup
        languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and
        XUL.
